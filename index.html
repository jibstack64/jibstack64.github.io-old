                    Know it all is a standalone executable for managing a set of data; whether it be people, passwords,
                    or credit-card details you can store it in an organised, catalogable way with KIAL.
                    It has useful features such as database encryption, decryption, searching and more. I aim to add
                    SSH(scp) and HTTP(S) reading and writing functionality for externally stored databases.

                    I hadn't done proper game development for a couple of years until this point; to get back into
                    the swing of gdev, I decided to make a Pong clone.

                    A small command-line game that I designed and wrote in C++.
                    You, the smiley face ☺ push the boxes ▩ onto the targets X. It has a series of parameters,
                    giving the player the option to customise the characters and maps.

                    Spotis.py is my implementation of a so-called "Playlist sniffer". When ran, it will
                    constantly "sniff" for playlists on the provided users - if any are removed, or created,
                    it will be logged to the console and/or a Discord webhook URL.

                    A console colouring library for C++, in a single header file. It is designed for Unix-like systems,
                    only using escape-sequences, however it does function on Windows 10 given that the program is running
                    in Powershell or the modern Command Prompt.
